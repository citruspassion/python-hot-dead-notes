# python-hot-dead-notes
A personal collection of Python syntax, tricks, and patterns I know but often forget to use. Python snippets, edge cases, and “oh right, this exists” moments.


## Why this repository?

While writing Python, I often run into this situation:

- I’ve learned a feature or syntax before  
- I remember thinking “this is useful”  
- But when I actually need it, I forget it exists  

This repository is meant to collect those pieces of knowledge so they’re easy to revisit and reuse.
